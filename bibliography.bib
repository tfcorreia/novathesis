abstract = {This handbook is designed as a stand-alone guide to thermoset resins, an important class of polymer materials. It begins with a general introduction to thermoset resins - including network concept, curing, processing, and testing - and ends with thermoset nanocomposites, a subject of much current interest. Its objective is to pre focused and detailed information on synthesis, characterizations, applications, and toughening of thermoset resins. In contrast to thermoplastics, where the toughening is achieved by simple physical blending, the same is achieved in thermoset resins exclusively through and presents a greater challenge to polymer scientists, as highlighted in this book.},

abstract = {Almost a decade has gone by since the second edition of this book was published. The fundamental understanding of fiber reinforcement has not changed, but many new advancements have taken place in the materials area, especially after the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991. There has also been increasing applications of composite materials, which started mainly in the aerospace industry in the 1950s, but now can be seen in many nonaerospace industries, including consumer goods, automotive, power transmission, and biomedical. It is now becoming a part of the ‘‘regular'' materials vocabulary. The third edition is written to update the book with recent advancements and applications. Almost all the chapters in the book have been extended with new informa- tion, example problems and chapter-end problems. Chapter 1 has been rewrit- ten to show the increasing range of applications of fiber-reinforced polymers and emphasize the material selection process. Chapter 2 has two new sections, one on natural fibers and the other on fiber architecture. Chapter 7 has a new section on carbon–carbon composites. Chapter 8 has been added to introduce polymer-based nanocomposites, which are the most recent addition to the composite family and are receiving great attention from both researchers as well as potential users. As before, I have tried to maintain a balance between materials, mechanics, processing and design of fiber-reinforced composites. This book is best-suited for senior-level undergraduate or first-level graduate students, who I believe will be able to acquire a broad knowledge on composite materials from this book. Numerous example problems and chapter-end problems will help them better understand and apply the concepts to practical solutions. Numerous references cited in the book will help them find additional research information and go deeper into topics that are of interest to them. I would like to thank the students, faculty and others who have used the earlier editions of this book in the past. I have received suggestions and encouragement from several faculty on writing the third edition—thanks to them. Finally, the editorial and production staff of the CRC Press needs to be acknowledged for their work and patience—thanks to them also. P.K.},
